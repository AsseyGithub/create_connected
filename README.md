## What's new in 0.3

![SPG](https://github.com/hlysine/create_connected/assets/25472513/0fcfe97c-b17b-4536-85a1-1c808f335f60) **Sequenced
Pulse Generator**

A highly-flexible programmable redstone diode. With a configuration GUI like the Sequenced Gearshift, it can be used to
mimic many other diodes or even execute simple logic! Make sure you have good farms and factories though, because this
thing is *not cheap*.

**Ponders**

Ponders are added for some of the components. This is still an on-going effort. Items that don't have ponders yet will
get a short summary instead.
